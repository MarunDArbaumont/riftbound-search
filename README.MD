# Search Riftbound cards 
This was supposed to be a riftbound project to get the cards, but the api isn't avaible in my country.

## TFT last match recap
The new project is a recap of the last tft game played.

You just need to execute the main.sh file and enter your account name and account tag.

For the program to actually work you need an API key from RIOT [riot developper portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
